/// Every failure mode in Fluxora is a typed error. Nothing panics on a numeric
/// edge case: all arithmetic is checked and maps to [`Error::Overflow`].
///
/// Zero-amount policy: zero or negative deposit, top-up, and explicit
/// withdrawal amounts are errors, not no-ops. No zero-value event is emitted
/// for a rejected operation, and balances are conserved.
///
/// Discriminants are part of the public ABI. Never renumber an existing
/// variant; only append.
///
/// ## Creation atomicity
/// Stream creation is transactional: `next_stream_id` and `stream_count` are
/// only mutated after all validation and the token transfer succeed. If any
/// phase fails, no ID is consumed and no count is incremented; stream IDs are
/// therefore contiguous with no gaps.
///
/// ## Terminal stream statuses
/// A stream reaches a terminal status when no further accrual or state change
/// is possible. Two distinct terminal statuses exist, and callers must be able
/// to tell them apart because they mean different things for retry logic:
///
/// - [`Error::StreamTerminated`] (discriminant 14) — the stream ended *early*.
///   It is reached when the sender `cancel`s the stream (`Cancelled`) or when
///   the recipient withdraws the exact withdrawable balance and the stream
///   becomes `Depleted`. Both are permanent: the stream can never accrue or be
///   resumed again.
/// - [`Error::StreamMatured`] (discriminant 15) — the stream ended *naturally*.
///   It is reached when the accrual clock has passed `end_time` and the full
///   deposit has vested. This is also permanent, but it signals successful
///   completion rather than an early stop.
///
/// Both terminal statuses are permanent, so a caller retrying a mutating
/// operation must not retry blindly: it should branch on which variant was
/// returned to distinguish an early stop from a natural completion.
///
/// [`StreamStatus::is_terminal`] covers exactly these two statuses
/// (discriminants 14 and 15) and nothing else.
