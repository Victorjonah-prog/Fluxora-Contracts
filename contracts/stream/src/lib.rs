#![no_std]
//! # Fluxora — continuous payment streaming for Soroban
//!
//! Lock tokens once; have them accrue continuously to a recipient over time.
//! The recipient pulls their accrued balance whenever they like.
//!
//! This contract is a *primitive*, not an application. Payroll tools, grant
//! programs, subscription billing and vesting schedules are meant to be built
//! on top of it. Every scoping decision below favours generality on chain and
//! pushes convenience to the SDK.
//!
//! ## Pull-based by necessity
//!
//! Stellar has no scheduler — no cron, no keeper network, no way for a contract
//! to wake itself up. Every state change must be triggered by an external
//! transaction. So nothing here runs in the background: the recipient calls
//! [`FluxoraStream::withdraw`] and the contract computes what they have earned
//! at that instant.
//!
//! ## No on-chain stream discovery
//!
//! There is deliberately no per-user list of stream ids in storage. A `Vec<u64>`
//! of a treasury's streams grows without bound, costs rent forever, and blows
//! Soroban's per-transaction footprint limit once that treasury has a few
//! hundred recipients. On chain, a stream is only ever addressed by its `u64`
//! id. `test::resource_limits` states the payoff as a test: the 153rd stream
//! costs exactly what the 2nd did.
//!
//! Discovery is an off-chain concern: [`create_stream`](FluxoraStream::create_stream)
//! returns the new id and emits an event carrying sender, recipient and every
//! schedule field — including the [`ReleaseCurve`] — so an indexer can answer
//! "show me my streams" without the contract paying rent to remember.
//!
//! ## Immutable guarantees
//!
//! `cancellable`, `pausable` and `transferable` are fixed at creation and can
//! never change afterwards. This is a trust feature: before accepting a stream a
//! recipient can verify that the sender cannot claw it back, freeze it, or
//! reassign it. A stream that could *become* cancellable later would be
//! worthless as a guarantee.
//!
//! For the same reason the contract has no upgrade path, no fee switch, no
//! admin rotation and nothing user-configurable in storage. Immutability is
//! what lets another protocol depend on this one.
//!
//! **Upgrade posture: the contract is immutable.** There is no `upgrade`
//! entry point, no admin, and no storage slot that could authorise replacing
//! the deployed WASM. See `docs/ABI.md` "Upgrade posture" and
//! `docs/MIGRATION.md` for the consequences.
//!
//! ## The single operator: an opt-in emergency halt (#1818)
//!
//! The one exception is the contract-level emergency stop. An operator can be
//! installed exactly once, by [`set_halt_operator`](FluxoraStream::set_halt_operator);
//! that operator may then stop *settlement* across every stream
//! ([`halt`](FluxoraStream::halt)) and start it again
//! ([`resume_contract`](FluxoraStream::resume_contract)). The design keeps the
//! guarantees above intact:
//!
//! * **Opt-in.** A deployment that never installs an operator has none, cannot
//!   be halted, and behaves exactly as it did before the halt existed. The
//!   operator is unset by default, which is why no existing behaviour changed.
//! * **One-shot.** There is no rotation entry point. A second
//!   `set_halt_operator` is rejected, so the operator cannot be swapped mid
//!   incident — replacing one means deploying a new contract.
//! * **No reach into funds or schedules.** The operator cannot withdraw,
//!   cancel, pause, top up, transfer, or change any stream. It can only refuse
//!   new mutations contract-wide.
//! * **Reads keep answering.** Every view stays live while halted, so an
//!   integrator can still see balances and streams during an incident.
//! * **Explicit resume.** There is no timeout: settlement restarts when the
//!   operator says so, and both transitions emit an event.
//!
//! `test::halt` is the acceptance test: it halts the contract and drives every
//! mutating entry point to [`Error::ContractHalted`] while asserting each read
//! still answers.
