//! Event definitions and emission.
//!
//! Stream discovery is an off-chain concern — the contract keeps no per-user
//! index (see the `lib.rs` module docs). That makes these events the *only* way
//! an indexer learns that a stream exists or that its state moved, so they are
//! load-bearing infrastructure rather than optional telemetry.
//!
//! # Contract
//!
//! * Every state change emits exactly one event.
//! * Events are declared with `#[contractevent]`, so their schemas land in the
//!   contract's interface spec. Tooling and the TypeScript SDK generate typed
//!   decoders from that spec instead of hand-rolling topic parsers.
//! * The static topic is the struct name in snake_case. `stream_id` is always a
//!   topic, as are the addresses an indexer routes on, so a consumer can filter
//!   server-side by event kind, by stream, or by party.
//! * Each payload carries enough state to reconstruct the stream without
//!   replaying from genesis.
//!
//! Field order and topic placement are ABI. Adding a field at the end of a struct is a compatible
//! change (additive versioning); reordering, removing, or re-topicking an existing field is an
//! incompatible breaking change. Indexers should tolerate unknown trailing fields.
//! Event ordering within a single operation is deterministic. Currently, a single state change
//! emits exactly one event, guaranteeing the event order aligns with the operation order.
//!
//! # Issue #1868 — every lifecycle event names the stream and both parties
//!
//! Reconstruction from events alone (the contract keeps no per-party index, so
//! that is the only way to answer "which streams are mine") makes two demands
//! on the payloads that the event set did not fully meet:
//!
//! * **Both parties, on every lifecycle event.** `stream_created` names both
//!   from the start, but `withdrawn` named only the recipient, `paused`,
//!   `resumed` and `topped_up` named only the sender, and
//!   `recipient_transferred` named the old and new recipient but not the
//!   sender. An indexer that starts mid-history, or that routes by address
//!   without joining back to `stream_created`, could not attribute those events
//!   to both sides of the stream. The missing party is therefore published as a
//!   **payload** field (`sender` on `withdrawn` and `recipient_transferred`,
//!   `recipient` on `paused`, `resumed` and `topped_up`): appending to the
//!   payload is the compatible change, whereas adding a topic is breaking.
//! * **The pause bookkeeping, where it moves.** `Stream.paused_at` and
//!   `Stream.paused_total` are moved by two entry points that do not emit a
//!   `paused`/`resumed` event of their own: a `withdraw` that drains a paused
//!   stream to zero folds the in-progress pause into `paused_total` and clears
//!   `paused_at`, and `cancel` clears `paused_at` on a stream that was paused.
//!   `withdrawn` and `cancelled` now republish both fields, so a replay never
//!   keeps a freeze point the contract has already dropped and never misses an
//!   interval it has already folded. Publishing `paused_at` even though a replay
//!   could infer the interval end from the withdrawal's ledger timestamp keeps
//!   the fold a pure function of the payloads, with no clock dependency.
//!
//! `ttl_extended` and the two delegate events are not stream-lifecycle events:
//! `ttl_extended` moves rent only, and the delegate events describe grants that
//! `get_stream` does not return. They carry `stream_id` for attribution and are
//! deliberately not required to name a party.
//! See `test::event_reconstruction` for the machine-checked form of all of this.
//!
//! # Topic namespace and collision prevention (issue #1585)
//!
//! `topic[0]` is a `Symbol` derived from the event struct's name in `snake_case`
//! by the soroban SDK macro. It serves as the **namespace** that uniquely
//! identifies each event type. No two structs in this module may produce the
//! same `topic[0]` symbol — a collision would make two distinct event kinds
//! indistinguishable to an indexer filtering by topic.
//!
//! **This invariant is enforced by `test::events::test_all_event_topic_names_are_unique`.**
//! That test emits every event type, collects the observed `topic[0]` symbols,
//! and asserts they match the exact known inventory with no duplicates.
//!
//! Versioning rule:
//! * **Additive (compatible):** append a new field at the end of the struct.
//! * **Breaking change:** rename, remove, reorder, or re-topic an existing field,
//!   or rename the struct. For a breaking change, introduce a new struct with a
//!   `V2` suffix and keep the old one for the migration window.
//!
//! Note that item-level doc comments on a `#[contractevent]` struct are copied
//! into the contract spec and therefore into the deployed wasm. Statements of
//! the ABI belong there; the reasoning behind them belongs here, where it costs
//! the contract nothing.
//!
//! # `Cancelled.vested`: total vested, not the withdrawable remainder
//!
//! Issue #1584. `cancelled` publishes `refunded`, `vested` and `withdrawn`,
//! which makes it a public accounting statement, and `vested` had two defensible
//! readings: everything the recipient has earned over the life of the stream, or
//! only the part of it they can still pull. The two differ exactly when the
//! recipient withdrew before the cancel.
//!
//! The ruling is **total vested**, cumulative and inclusive of `withdrawn`,
//! because that is the reading that keeps the event self-checking:
//!
//! * Conservation holds unconditionally: `refunded + vested` equals the
//!   pre-cancel `deposited` for every stream. Under the withdrawable reading
//!   that identity fails for any partially withdrawn stream, and a reconciler
//!   could no longer tell a broken contract from an ordinary one.
//! * No information is lost. The event carries `withdrawn`, so the remainder is
//!   `vested - withdrawn`. The reverse does not hold — from the remainder
//!   alone, total vested is unrecoverable.
//! * It matches storage one-for-one: cancellation rewrites `deposited` to the
//!   vested amount, so an indexer mirroring `deposited` assigns the field
//!   directly. [`cancelled`] reads it straight off the settled stream for that
//!   reason, which is what makes divergence between event and storage
//!   unrepresentable rather than merely untested.
//!
//! The cancel itself moves nothing to the recipient: they still pull
//! `vested - withdrawn` through the normal withdraw path, which is why that
//! amount stays pooled in the contract. Every cancellation state is asserted
//! against storage and token balances in `test::cancel_events`.
