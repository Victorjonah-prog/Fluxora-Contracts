//! Same-ledger top_up + withdraw coverage.
//!
//! # The scenario
//!
//! `top_up` changes `deposited` and `end_time` in storage.  `withdraw` reads
//! `vested = deposited * elapsed / duration` from storage.  When both land in
//! the same ledger at the same timestamp the value `withdraw` sees depends on
//! whether `top_up` has already written its changes.
//!
//! # Why the ordering does not change the withdrawable amount
//!
//! The top-up formula is rate-preserving by design:
//!
//! ```text
//! before:  deposited     , duration     = elapsed / duration * deposited
//! top_up:  deposited + Δ , duration + δ   where δ = Δ * duration / deposited  (rounded down)
//! after:   vested'       = (deposited + Δ) * elapsed / (duration + δ)
//! ```
//!
//! Because `δ = Δ * duration / deposited` (floored), the new rate
//! `(deposited + Δ) / (duration + δ)` is **at least** the old rate.  Combined
//! with the post-top-up `VestedDecreased` guard inside `top_up`, the vested
//! amount at a fixed instant is guaranteed to be **unchanged or at most one
//! stroop higher** after the call.  It can never decrease (invariant I3).
//!
//! Consequently:
//!
//! * `top_up → withdraw`:  withdraw sees the updated `deposited` and `duration`;
//!   the vested amount is the same as it was before the top-up (I3 guarantee),
//!   so the payout is unchanged.
//! * `withdraw → top_up`:  withdraw reads the original values, pays out the
//!   correct vested amount, then top_up extends the schedule.
//!
//! Either way the recipient receives exactly `floor(deposited * elapsed /
//! duration)` from before the top-up, the pool stays balanced, and the
//! combined post-call state satisfies every invariant.
//!
//! # What these tests assert
//!
//! * Both orderings yield the same net outcome across a sweep of schedule
//!   points (quarter, halfway, near-end).
//! * Funds conservation holds exactly after both calls complete:
//!   `pool == original_deposited + top_up_amount - withdrawn_amount`.
//! * The emitted `ToppedUp` and `Withdrawn` events match storage and the
//!   token ledger exactly.
//! * The final stream state (deposited, withdrawn, end_time) is coherent.
//! * The test fails if the rate-preserving invariant (I3) is violated.
//!
//! # Scope
//!
//! This module does **not** advance the ledger clock between the two calls in
//! the same-ledger pair.  That is the technique from `withdraw_cancel_same_ledger`
//! and is what pins the same-ledger case rather than two-ledger sequencing.
//!
//! docs/same-ledger-ordering.md does not list top_up + withdraw as an
//! ordering-sensitive pair (the four listed pairs are auth- and
//! terminal-state-sensitive).  These tests confirm that the pair is in fact
//! *not* ordering-sensitive from a conservation and vested-amount standpoint,
//! and pin that property so a future change cannot quietly break it.
