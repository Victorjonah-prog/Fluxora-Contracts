//! Issue #1711 — accounting identity for the three unwithdrawn views.
//!
//! ```text
//! refundable(t) + withdrawable(t) == liability == deposited - withdrawn
//! ```
//!
//! `accrual::refundable` is `deposited - vested` and `accrual::withdrawable` is
//! `vested - withdrawn`, so their sum is exactly `deposited - withdrawn`, which
//! is `accrual::liability`. That relationship is the contract's accounting
//! identity: every unwithdrawn stroop is either still locked for the sender
//! (refundable) or already earned by the recipient (withdrawable). Asserting it
//! directly catches any divergence between the three functions that pairwise
//! checks against `vested` alone would miss.
//!
//! Coverage:
//! * a pure property test over arbitrary schedules and withdrawal levels;
//! * contract-level checks before the cliff, mid-schedule, and after maturity;
//! * the same identity while paused and after a top-up;
//! * a sensitivity check proving a deliberate change to any of the three terms
//!   breaks the identity assertion.
