//! Issue #1850 — `stream_exists` for an id beyond `stream_count()`.
//!
//! `stream_exists(id)` answers a boolean question, but two distinct facts sit
//! behind it:
//!
//! * the **id counter** (`stream_count()`), which only moves forward and records
//!   every id ever issued; and
//! * the **persistent population** (`DataKey::Stream(id)`), which an entry can
//!   leave — by archiving once its TTL runs out — without the counter moving.
//!
//! An id at or beyond the counter has never been issued; an id *below* the
//! counter that is missing from storage was issued and is now archived. Both
//! make `stream_exists` return `false` and both make every `Result` view return
//! `StreamNotFound`, so the only discriminator is the comparison against
//! `stream_count()` that `docs/ABI.md` (Client requirements) prescribes:
//! `id < stream_count()` means "archived, needs restoring", while
//! `id >= stream_count()` means "never issued".
//!
//! This module pins that boundary — that it tracks the population as it grows,
//! that a failed create does not move it, that probing it is free of side
//! effects, and that it is distinguishable from an archived id — end to end
//! through the public ABI.
//!
//! | acceptance criterion | test |
//! |---|---|
//! | exercised end to end through the public ABI | `the_boundary_scenario_conserves_funds_end_to_end` |
