//! Same-ledger withdraw + cancel coverage (issue #1833).
//!
//! # The problem
//!
//! Both `withdraw` and `cancel` settle funds: `withdraw` transfers vested tokens
//! to the recipient; `cancel` transfers the unvested remainder back to the
//! sender. When both happen in the same ledger (identical timestamp), the vested
//! amount is fixed — the same number at both call sites. The ordering therefore
//! decides whether that amount can be paid twice.
//!
//! Concretely, if order were `cancel → withdraw`:
//! - `cancel` fixes `deposited = vested_now` and refunds the rest
//! - `withdraw` then reads `vested_now` against the new (shrunken) schedule
//!   and pays it out
//! - **Nothing was withdrawn before the cancel**, so the full `vested_now` is
//!   paid both ways — a double-payment
//!
//! The contract prevents this through the normal `withdrawn` accounting in
//! `withdrawable = vested - withdrawn`: cancel does not move `withdrawn`, so
//! after cancel the recipient can still pull exactly `vested - withdrawn`, not
//! `vested` again.
//!
//! # What this module asserts
//!
//! - The two orderings at the same timestamp yield the same net outcome.
//! - Funds conservation holds exactly: `recipient_delta + sender_delta == deposit`.
//! - The pool is exactly drained (no stranded tokens, no shortfall).
//! - The emitted events match the settled storage state and token ledger.
//! - Final stream state is `Cancelled` (or `Depleted` for a fully-matured stream),
//!   with `deposited == withdrawn == total_vested_at_that_instant`.
//! - The test fails if the behaviour it pins is changed.
//!
//! # Coverage
//!
//! | scenario | offset | what is interesting |
//! |---|---|---|
//! | At `start_time` | 0 | nothing vested; withdraw errors first |
//! | Quarter | 25 d | partial vesting, both orderings |
//! | Halfway | 50 d | symmetric point |
//! | Near end | 99 d | almost fully vested |
//! | Exact end | 100 d | fully vested → stream depletes, cancel is rejected |
//! | Post end | 150 d | past maturity, same as exact end |
//! | Pre-withdraw partial | mid + partial | recipient had already drawn some |
