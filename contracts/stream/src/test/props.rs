//! Stage 1 — property tests over the accrual math.
//!
//! These drive [`crate::accrual`] directly rather than going through the
//! contract. The functions there are pure, so a case is a few microseconds
//! instead of a host invocation, which buys enough cases to actually explore
//! the space of schedules.
//!
//! # The conservation property
//!
//! The headline invariant is stronger than "dust is bounded":
//!
//! ```text
//! vested(t) + refundable(t) == deposited      for all t
//! ```
//!
//! *Exactly*, with no dust term at all. That falls out of computing `vested`
//! from the cumulative formula `deposited * elapsed / duration` rather than by
//! summing per-interval deltas. Truncation error therefore never accumulates:
//! it is re-derived from scratch on every call and bounded by one stroop at any
//! instant, and it vanishes entirely once the stream settles, because
//! `refundable` is *defined* as the complement of `vested`.
//!
//! A per-interval implementation — the obvious one, and the one the existing
//! MVPs use — loses a stroop per withdrawal and strands it in the pool forever.
