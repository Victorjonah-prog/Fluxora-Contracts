//! The documented migration path, exercised (#1870).
//! The documented migration path, exercised (#1870).
//!
//! `docs/MIGRATION.md` is the only place that tells a caller how to move from
//! the pre-v1 surface onto v1: which functions were renamed, which were
//! deleted, and — for the two that kept their names — how their signatures
//! changed. Nothing tested it, so the document could drift away from the
//! contract in either direction and no build would notice.
//!
//! This module closes that gap from both ends:
//!
//! * the **document** is parsed and cross-checked against the committed ABI
//!   inventory (`contracts/stream/abi/fluxora_stream.json`), so a rename the
//!   document still advertises as v1 — or a v1 entry point the document omits —
//!   fails a named test;
//! * the **path** is then walked live, call by call, using only what the
//!   document says to call, and the *behaviour* the document promises for each
//!   renamed function is asserted: `top_up` extends duration and never the
//!   rate, `transfer_recipient` is one step gated by the immutable
//!   `transferable` flag, `withdraw` with `None` means "take everything
//!   accrued", and the views that replaced `get_stream_state` and friends
//!   answer the same questions.
//!
//! It also pins the documented *upgrade posture*: the contract exposes no
//! upgrade entry point, so the document must say so, and the ABI must not
//! contain any of the upgrade functions a caller might otherwise assume.
//!
//! # Why the document is parsed rather than restated
//!
//! A test that hard-codes the rename table only proves the test agrees with
//! itself. Parsing §4 of the file makes the *document* the source of truth: edit
//! the table without editing the contract and
//! [`documented_v1_names_are_all_real_entry_points`] fails; delete a v1 entry
//! point the table still lists and it fails again. The hard-coded expectation
//! in [`the_renames_table_still_describes_the_documented_migration`] is the
//! mirror of that, and exists so a table that is quietly emptied or reflowed
//! cannot pass by accident.
//!
//! # What "state is asserted intact" means here
//!
//! The migration is a change of *caller*, not of protocol, so nothing about a
//! stream that predates it may move: after each step of the walked path the
//! stream's accounting identities are re-checked
//! ([`Harness::assert_invariants`]) and the token pool is required to still
//! equal the outstanding liability ([`Harness::assert_pool_exact`]). A rename
//! that silently changed an amount, or dropped a party, would show up as a
//! broken identity rather than as a passing call.
