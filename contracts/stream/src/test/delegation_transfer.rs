//! Issue #1845 — Delegation surviving a recipient transfer.
//!
//! # The question
//!
//! When a stream's recipient changes via `transfer_recipient`, what happens to
//! existing `Delegate(stream_id, delegate)` entries?  Two behaviours are
//! conceivable:
//!
//! 1. **Grants follow the stream** — they are stored under
//!    `(stream_id, delegate)`, not under `(recipient, delegate)`, so a transfer
//!    does not touch them.  A delegate that held `WITHDRAW` before the transfer
//!    can still call `delegate_withdraw` after it; the payout now goes to the
//!    *new* recipient, as it must, because `apply_withdrawal` always reads
//!    `stream.recipient` from live storage.
//!
//! 2. **Grants are silently cleared** — the transfer removes every grant that
//!    names the old recipient, treating the slot change as an implicit revoke.
//!
//! docs/ABI.md documents option 1:
//!
//! > "A transfer reassigns who is paid; it does not touch
//! > `Delegate(stream_id, delegate)` entries. Recipient-issued grants therefore
//! > pass to the new holder of the recipient slot."
//!
//! # What these tests prove
//!
//! | Test | What it pins |
//! |---|---|
//! | `withdraw_delegate_pays_new_recipient_after_transfer` | End-to-end: `WITHDRAW` grant survives, payout reaches the *new* recipient, conservation exact, events match storage |
//! | `stale_delegate_cannot_divert_funds_to_old_recipient` | After transfer the delegate's payout is determined by the live `stream.recipient` — the old address is unreachable |
//! | `sender_grant_survives_recipient_transfer` | Sender-side grants (`CANCEL`, `PAUSE`, `RESUME`, `TOP_UP`) are unaffected because the sender did not change |
//! | `new_recipient_can_revoke_surviving_withdraw_grant` | Authority over a survived recipient-issued grant moves to the new recipient immediately |
//! | `old_recipient_cannot_revoke_after_transfer` | The displaced recipient is no longer a party; revocation is rejected |
//! | `funds_conservation_holds_across_transfer_and_delegate_withdraw` | Pool invariant and exact conservation after the full sequence |

/// # Scenario
///
/// 1. Create a 1 000 ONE / 100-day stream (`sender` → `recipient`).
/// 2. At day 40, `recipient` grants `WITHDRAW` to `agent`.
/// 3. `sender` reassigns the stream to `new_recipient` (a fresh address) via
///    `transfer_recipient`.
/// 4. At day 60, `agent` calls `delegate_withdraw(None)`.
///
/// # Expected outcomes (all per docs/ABI.md)
///
/// * `delegate_withdraw` succeeds — `DelegateNotPermitted` would mean the grant
///   was cleared on transfer.
/// * The payout (200 ONE: days 41–60 at 10 ONE/day) goes to `new_recipient`,
///   not to the original `recipient`.  The delegate only authorises the
///   operation; the destination is always `stream.recipient`.
/// * The old `recipient` receives no tokens from the stream.
/// * Pool conservation is exact after every step.
/// * The `withdrawn` event carries `new_recipient` as the `recipient` topic and
///   matches storage byte-for-byte.
