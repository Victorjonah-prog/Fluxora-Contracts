//! Issue #1805 — detect a rebasing token that desynchronises the pool.
//!
//! `docs/KNOWN-LIMITATIONS.md` §6 recorded that an elastic-supply token could
//! change the pool's real balance between two operations without the contract
//! noticing: the deposit leg measures a balance *delta* (so it catches
//! fee-on-transfer), but nothing re-read the pool afterwards. The pool total
//! Fluxora now maintains per token in [`DataKey::PooledBalance`] closes that
//! hole — every funds-moving operation ends by reconciling the total against
//! the token's own `balance`, and a shortfall is rejected with
//! [`Error::PoolBalanceDrift`].
//!
//! # The fixture
//!
//! [`RebasingToken`] is a SEP-41-shaped token whose balances live in its own
//! instance storage, plus one test-only entry point — [`rebase_to`] — that
//! overwrites a balance *without* any transfer. That is precisely what an
//! elastic-supply rebase does, and it is the only way to arrange the failure
//! this issue is about: a balance change Fluxora is not a party to, so there is
//! no transfer to instrument.
//!
//! Every test here drives the contract through its public ABI; the rebase is
//! the only thing injected out-of-band, exactly as it would be on chain.
//!
//! [`DataKey::PooledBalance`]: crate::DataKey::PooledBalance
//! [`rebase_to`]: RebasingTokenClient::rebase_to
