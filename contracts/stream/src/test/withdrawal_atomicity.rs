//! Regression tests for issue #1571 — withdrawal bookkeeping atomicity.
//!
//! # What this tests
//!
//! `apply_withdrawal` updates `stream.withdrawn` (and possibly `stream.status`)
//! and persists the stream *before* calling the token contract's `transfer`.
//! The comment in `apply_withdrawal` explains the ordering choice: it is the
//! standard checks-effects-interactions pattern, and Soroban's host forbids
//! reentrancy outright, so there is no classical reentrancy risk.
//!
//! The correctness argument for atomicity is different: on Soroban, **every
//! host trap propagates as a Rust panic that unwinds the entire transaction**.
//! The Soroban test host replicates this exactly — if a nested contract call
//! panics, control unwinds back to the outermost `invoke_contract` call and
//! all storage writes made in that invocation are discarded.  No committed
//! state leaks out of a failed transaction.
//!
//! These tests *prove* that claim in the context of `withdraw` and
//! `batch_withdraw`.  Each test:
//!
//! 1. Establishes a stream with a non-zero withdrawable balance.
//! 2. Engineers a token `transfer` failure (two mechanisms, see below).
//! 3. Calls `withdraw` / `batch_withdraw` via `catch_unwind` and observes the
//!    panic.
//! 4. Reads stream state and token balances **after** the panic and asserts
//!    they are byte-for-byte identical to what they were before.
//!
//! Nothing is permanently marked withdrawn; no double-pay is possible on retry.
//!
//! # Two failure mechanisms exercised
//!
//! ## 1. SAC authorization revoked (`set_authorized`)
//!
//! The Stellar Asset Contract rejects a `transfer` whose `to` address is not
//! authorized to hold the asset.  We call `token_admin.set_authorized(&recipient,
//! &false)` before the withdrawal.  For this to work the issuer account must
//! have the `AUTH_REVOCABLE_FLAG` (bit 2) set; the `RevocableHarness` below
//! arranges this via `StellarAssetIssuer::set_flag`.
//!
//! ## 2. Always-panicking token contract
//!
//! A minimal contract registered at the same address as the real token (using
//! `env.register_at`, which replaces the existing contract) that always panics
//! in its `transfer` implementation.  This covers a hard host-level trap rather
//! than a soft contract error, and proves that even a maximally hostile token
//! cannot corrupt bookkeeping.
