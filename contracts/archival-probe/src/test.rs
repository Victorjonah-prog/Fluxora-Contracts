#![cfg(test)]

//! Tests for the archival probe (#1863).
//!
//! The probe is the mechanism by which archival problems are detected, and it is
//! deliberately tiny: three entry points, one storage key, no auth, no value.
//! That makes it easy to assume it still works — and a silent break in it does
//! not fail anything else, it removes a signal. So these tests pin its whole
//! surface rather than its happy path.
//!
//! Three things are asserted that the original smoke test did not:
//!
//! * **the archived state is exercised, not just described.** The SDK test host
//!   auto-restores an expired entry on read, so `test.rs` can never *observe*
//!   archival. What it can observe is the state the probe reports once the entry
//!   is gone, which is what an SDK keys on: `planted()` false and `read()`
//!   `NotPlanted`. That is the same distinction
//!   `FluxoraStream::stream_exists` draws, and it is what makes "archived, needs
//!   restoring" tellable from "never planted".
//! * **the entry point surface is complete.** Every entry point the probe
//!   exports is invoked here, and the exported set is taken from the contract
//!   spec, so removing or renaming one fails these tests by name.
//! * **the probe's whole point is preserved.** It extends no TTL and grows no
//!   state: a probe that quietly extended its entry, or accumulated keys, would
//!   still "pass" a round-trip test while no longer archiving on schedule.

// The crate is `no_std`; the test build has a host, and these tests need it.
